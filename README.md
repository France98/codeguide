Code Guideline
----------------------------------------------
1.Use the variable name that easy to understand
You should create the name of variable that easy to understand. Variable will tell the reader what the variable represents.

```
	Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
  	System.out.println("What is your name: ");
    	String n = s.nextLine();
  	System.out.print("My name is " + n);

```
