Code Guideline
----------------------------------------------
1.Use the variable name that easy to understand
You should create the name of variable that easy to understand. Variable will tell the reader what the variable represents.

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("What is your name: ");
		String n = s.nextLine();
		System.out.print("My name is " + n);
	}

```
